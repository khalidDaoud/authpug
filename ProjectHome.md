Authpug is an alternative authentication server for those wishing to set up a captive portal with the Wifidog gateway client.

It distinguishes itself from existing implementations with its small size and versatility: Authpug fashions itself as an adjunct to a CMS rather than an implementation of one.

Authpug is known to work with Wordpress 3, and will likely work with just about any other CMS given some redirection, parameter passing, and cookie magic.
